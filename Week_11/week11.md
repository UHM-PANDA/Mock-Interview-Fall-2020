# Week 11: “Graph it out”

#### 1) Search a Maze
Given a 2-d array filled with 1's and 0's representring closed and open spaces respectivley, and coordinates representring the start and end positions, output a 1 if a path exists between the beginning and end coordinates, and 0 if no path exists.

#### 2) Clone a graph
Given a reference to a vertex in a graph, create a copy of the graph that is reachable by the input vertex.

#### 3) Check to see if a graph is a bipartite graph
A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V and vice versa. Given a reference to a vertex in the graph, determine if the graph is a bigraph or not.
