# Week 11: “Graph it out”

#### 1) Enumerate Primes
Return a array of all primes less than a int n.
```
Input: 	6
Output:	[2, 3, 5]
```
#### 2) Overlapping Rectangles
Given the vertices of two rectangles.
```
Input:    rec1 = [[0,0],           rec2 = [[0,0],
                  [0,5]                    [0,1]
                  [5,5]                    [1,1]
                  [5,0]].                  [1,0]].
Output: True
```
#### 3) Sock merchant problem
There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
```
Input: arr=[1,2,1,2,1,3,2]
Output: 2
```
